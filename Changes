[0.04] Released 2009-09-09

     Test diagnostics are now passed through to STDOUT and STDERR,
     and these will be presented by TeamCity in the "details" for
     each test failure.  However, TeamCity strips out the newlines,
     so the presentation isn't very pretty.

     The code for doing this is not very pretty either.  TeamCity
     is sensitive about the order of the messages is receives.  So
     all the diagnostic info has to come between the testStarted
     and testFinished messages.  But with TAP, it isn't easy to know
     where the test begins and ends.

     It seems to work for now, but I'll probably re-write it in
     the near future.
